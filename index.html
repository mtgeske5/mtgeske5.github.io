        <p>
          Getting a Bachelor’s degree is something that I have tried to achieve for many years, many majors, and many different
          schools; all of which I have eventually stopped trying. I was unsure of what exactly I wanted to do and what I wanted
          to spend my time learning. After years of failing that goal, I decided to join the military and only a couple years ago
          did I feel comfortable enough to give college another try. Southern New Hampshire University offered me a flexible
          option to succeed in the path that I wanted: Computer Science. Each class in the program gave me such an opportunity
          to learn different methods, standards, languages, and even more. Not only do I have an understanding of a lot of
          different fields within the computer science realm, but I also feel as if employers will be very attracted to what I have
          to offer. This capstone class has enabled me to integrate everything I have learned from those classes into large
          projects in which I can showcase to future employers. I have been able to refine my skills in software engineering,
          algorithms and data structures, and databases while including the other skills like security implementation within
          those topics.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the software design realm, I emphasized modularity, readability, and maintainability. In software design, it is
          extremely important to be able to balance the give and takes when it comes to performance, memory, and security.
          CS-250, CS-330, and CS-340 all reinforced the importance of the trade-off analysis and structure design. These
          classes taught me approaches in developing a standardized method to create what I wanted the program to look like.
          For data structures and algorithms, I learned how evaluating lists, hash tables, and algorithmic strategies are used to
          create efficient and scalable solutions rather than simply functional ones. These experiences strengthened my ability
          to break complex problems into manageable components, reason through multiple solution paths, and justify design
          decisions in a professional setting. Lastly, my proficiency in database applications went from minimal to experienced.
          Using SQL and MongoDB, I was able to design schemas and implement CRUD functionalities. This allowed me to
          integrate databases into actual useful programs. This also gave me the opportunity to learn more about the Python
          language, which intrigues me with its flexibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          My work in the military taught me to have a security first mindset, and the computer science coursework has reiterated
          how important security is when developing code. CS-405 and CS-410 allowed me to identify vulnerabilities and
          understand the cause and effect of not implementing security early on in the development process. I believe I became
          proficient in identifying some security flaws like input validation or unsafe memory handling. These courses completely
          changed how I approach a new project by ensuring security is included within every step of the way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Collaboration and communication were probably the most difficult aspects for me to learn. It is easy to get into the zone
          and develop code that I understand, but to receive peer feedback and code reviews it is necessary to be communicative
          early on. Eventually, I learned how to explain the technical concepts and design decisions that I was aiming for. The
          code review really showcased how much my abilities have grown to effectively collaborate and communicate with
          everyone involved in the development process. Through documentation, code reviews, and design justification, I learned
          how to present technical decisions in a way that supports stakeholder understanding and informed decision making.
          My ePortfolio combines the artifacts that I spent a lot of time refining, as well as, demonstrates my capabilities across
          those three large topics. It shows how I analyze problems, creatively design code, and implement enhancements. It also
          reflects on how my thought process leads to my decision making in this enhancements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, the computer science program and the capstone experience have not only prepared me for the future, but it has
          given me a streamlined idea of what area I want to focus in as I start applying for jobs post military. I believe I have
          developed a strong technical understanding with a security-first mindset that aligns with industry needs. My ePortfolio
          will represent my readiness to solve, collaborate, and deliver high quality projects.

          <h3>Narrative</h3>
          <p>
            The artifact I selected comes from my previous CS-330 course. The program I created includes basic rendering of
            objects and camera movement using OpenGL. I created a scene from my kitchen that has a coffee pot, mug, and spoon.
            It involved a lot of different shapes and shading, but the more intricate part was to include zooming in/out and
            letting the operator choose their view. To enhance the project, I restructured the project into module components by
            integrating external libraries, implementing shader based rendering, and then adding texture loading functionalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought this project would be a great addition to my ePortfolio because it shows clear growth in my software design
            and engineering. The original version was very basic level knowledge, but the enhancements showcase my ability to
            involve multiple dependencies and use external libraries. Using dedicated managers for shaders, scenes, views and
            shapes is a more standard method for developers to keep a maintainable design. I also had to manage tradeoffs with
            performance and complexity which is a common problem in the computer graphic industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The programs I created in my earlier classes were simple designs to meet the criteria, however, these enhancements
            give me the ability to be creative while understanding the wanted outcome. I wanted to make this program be industry
            standard while balancing performance tradeoffs to demonstrate my ability to apply structured programming techniques
            and integrating third party technologies. The original outcome still covers the overall goal of the software
            development, but my enhancements support my engineering competency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enhancing this artifact led to plenty of challenges. For one, working with the graphic API’s was an issue because when
            I first created the program I used the provided virtual desktop. Resource management and defensive programming are
            two strategies that I really wanted to focus on when integrating the external libraries. This took a lot of patience to
            make sure when loading that it compiled correctly. Debugging runtime errors related to OpenGL state and driver behavior
            reinforced the difference between compile time success and runtime correctness. I think I actually learned a lot more
            about the process because of the failures I dealt with. I used different problem solving techniques used in the industry
            to de-bug and create a program that worked the way I wanted it to. Overall, these enhancements tested my abilities,
            but I was able to use real-world debugging practices to fully enhance the original artifact.

          </div>

          <h3>Narrative</h3>
          <p>
            I decided to choose an artifact that I originally spent a lot of time working on because of the complexity involved.
            I chose the learning based Treasure Hunt game that I created in the previous fall in CS-370. This program involved an
            understanding of a Deep Q learning network, and how the agent is able to learn over time based on the strategies
            provided. The implementation of a DQN allowed for an AI agent to progress through a maze and eventually learn all the
            ins and outs in order to complete the maze with 100% accuracy no matter where the agent started the maze. The original
            version relied on standard experience using uniform random sampling as the method to train the AI agent’s neural network.
          </p>
          <p>
            This artifact demonstrates my ability to design and evaluate the computing solutions using algorithmic principles and
            data structures. The project involves a lot of strategy as to discovering which is the most efficient method of neural
            understanding between uncertainties, reward based, and iterative optimization.
          </p>
          <p>
            To enhance this project, I replaced the uniform experience replay with prioritized experience replay (PER). Originally,
            the training samples were drawn from memory and each past experience was treated equally. The PER method assigns higher
            sampling probability to experiences with a larger error. This completely changes the way the agent thinks and understands
            previous decisions made. It requires a new data structure to track the agent’s previous decisions and prioritize them
            with a weighted sample.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both methods of learning may lead to the same result in the end, but algorithmically this enhancement improves the
            learning efficiency because the agent is able to replay more informative experiences even more frequently. The downside
            may be the agent’s ability to maintain diversity in it’s samples, but it introduces dynamic priority updates based on
            prediction error. The program originally allows me to change the parameters to adjust the agent’s neural network, but by
            changing the sampling strategy I am able to demonstrate how data structures and algorithmic trade offs can more
            efficiently and accurately complete the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            The overall goal of this enhancement was to showcase my progress in designing and evaluating computing solutions with
            the use of algorithmic principles and appropriate data structures. The prioritized replay buffer addition required
            integrating a different strategy of sampling that balances complexity and performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The enhancement required me to look at the program from a different perspective by changing the data structure instead
            of the parameters. By implementing this method, I was able to further my understanding of how to directly influence the
            behavior and system performance. One of the main challenges was understanding the program as a whole because originally,
            I was only able to edit a specific part of the program that did not involve adjusting the data structure. I didn’t want
            to rewrite the program that adjusted the goal, but integrating the prioritize replay was an option to keep the program’s
            intentions while upgrading it’s efficiency. This process increased my knowledge in algorithmic improvements and it
            increased my understanding of technological trade-offs. Balancing these factors are real-life challenges that I will face
            and this enhancement highlights my ability to logically understand the importance of algorithmic performance and system
            behavior making this a strong addition to my ePortfolio.

            </a>
          </div>

          <h3>Narrative</h3>
          <p>
            The artifact I chose was from the CS-340 class where I worked on creating a database with the CRUD strategy. The original
            artifact includes an AnimalShelter class that used the basic create, read, update, and delete operations. I used basic
            Python and MongoDB skills to complete the required database actions. To enhance this database, I expanded it to include a
            REST style API layer with Flask. It supports externally accessible database operations through HTTP endpoints.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought this would be a great artifact to include in my ePortfolio because of the overall practicality of databases and
            how I was able to increase its capabilities. Databases are used in just about every software system, so being able to design
            and improve them is a practice that should be mastered for future employment opportunities. My enhancements for this specific
            artifact include isolating the database access logic within the AnimalShelter class by introducing application layers and input
            validation. Databases are more than likely not accessed through direct application code, so being able to access through APIs is
            definitely more industry standard. I added the REST interface to show the CRUD operations, as well as, including input validation
            and centralized error handling.
          </p>
          <p>
            In module 1, I proposed to make these changes because I think a database should be more robust with more accesses and the ability
            to be reused. I believe I improved the abilities and efficiencies from the original artifact. I was able to learn a lot on databases
            as a whole by thinking backwards and trying to research how a database should look professionally and adding those properties to the
            enhanced artifact.
          </p>
          <p>
            From my understanding, separating database logic and application logic improves efficiency and usage. The REST API layer really clarified
            how databases are commonly accessed in larger real-world environments. I think the biggest challenge was the error handling and figuring out
            the best way for the database to handle invalid input or database connectivity issues. All of this can be squared away by designing with
            security in mind because poor error handling could lead to vulnerabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Addressing these challenges helped strengthen my understanding of defensive programming and the security implications of exposing database
            operations through an application interface.
